                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">1. FABER Lotto GmbH & Co. KG, Markstraße 79, 44801 Bochum (hereinafter
                        referred to as "Faber") arranges participation in the events "Lotto 6aus49" (including Game 77
                        and Super 6) and "Eurojackpot" to a lottery company of the German Lotto and Toto block. Faber
                        acts towards the respective lottery company in the name, for the account and on behalf of the
                        players. The general terms and conditions of the respective lottery company to which the game
                        order was arranged are therefore exclusively valid for the game contracts. The general terms and
                        conditions of the lottery companies can be accessed via the websites of the respective lottery
                        companies, which are linked to the website www.lotto.de. The power of attorney granted to Faber
                        Lotto with this contract includes in particular the authority to conclude game contracts for the
                        player, which include the general terms and conditions of the respective lottery company.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Faber is commissioned by the player to submit the game tickets he has
                        submitted online via the website www.faber.de to a lottery company. To ensure proper processing,
                        Faber entrusts a trustee with the following tasks:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        <li>Keeping the game receipts safe for 6 months from the time of participation in the game</li>

                    </h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Faber's general terms and conditions are freely available for viewing and
                        printing on the website www.faber.de. Faber's general terms and conditions are part of the
                        contract in the version valid at the time the tip is submitted.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">3. Conditions for participating</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">3.1. For legal reasons, only people residing in Germany are entitled
                        to participate.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">3.2. To protect young people, people who are under 18 at the time of
                        submitting their ticket are also excluded from using Faber's game offer. A game contract is
                        therefore not concluded with them under any circumstances.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">3.3. Faber can block potential participants from playing, for example
                        if the game account is not covered (see also point 7.1 and point 7.2), the set limit of the game
                        account is exceeded, there is a case of misuse or a credit check has been negative. Multiple
                        registration of a player and corresponding management of multiple game accounts is also not
                        permitted.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">3.4. Until full identification and authentication, the maximum stake in the
                        first 3 days is 100 euros. The total stake limit is 1,000 euros per month. Faber reserves the
                        right to change and set the stake limit for each participant individually, taking this stake
                        limit into account.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-6">
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">4. Registration and placing an order</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">4.1. Before playing for the first time, a player must register on the
                        website www.faber.de. Faber reserves the right not to accept a registration for important
                        reasons. As part of the electronic registration process, the company is also entitled to check
                        the player's details regarding address, date of birth and bank details by comparing them with
                        reference files from Schufa Holding AG. If the comparison with the reference file or PostIdent
                        process does not confirm that the player is of legal age and/or does not match the name to the
                        address provided, the player is initially excluded from participating in the game. In this case,
                        the player must contact customer service for authentication.
                        After entering the required personal data, a player account is set up for the player and a fixed
                        customer number is assigned to them. During registration, the player provides their email
                        address and a personal password. These are then used to log in and log out, although the player
                        can change the password as they wish.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">4.2. After successful registration, a player can submit a ticket to be
                        sent to a lottery company via their participation account with Faber up until the deadline set
                        by Faber. Regardless of the lottery company's deadlines, Faber sets its own deadline for orders
                        to send tickets.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">4.2.1. When submitting a ticket for "Lotto 6aus49", the player can
                        choose between Lotto Normal and Lotto System. They must also select the draw day (Saturday and
                        Wednesday or Saturday or Wednesday), the number of lottery fields (at least one) and the
                        validity period of the ticket. The participant can choose the numbers within a lottery field
                        themselves or have them generated by Faber. The stake and fees for a ticket depend on the number
                        of lottery fields and the term. In addition, the offer to play in the additional lottery game
                        Super 6 and / or Game 77 can be used.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">4.2.2. When submitting a ticket for the "Eurojackpot" lottery, the
                        player must select the number of lottery fields (at least one) and the validity period of the
                        ticket. He must also select the day of the draw (Friday and Tuesday or Friday or Tuesday). The
                        participant can choose the numbers within a lottery field himself or have them generated by
                        Faber. The stake and fees for a ticket depend on the number of lottery fields and the term.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">4.2.3. The player can freely choose the term of a ticket between one
                        and five weeks.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">4.2.4. All stakes and fees are charged in advance.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">4.2.5. A completed ticket is placed in the shopping cart. Tickets
                        collected there can be changed until the ticket is finally submitted to Faber. The final
                        submission takes place when Faber orders the ticket to be forwarded to a lottery company. In
                        addition to the Lotto or Eurojackpot draws, tickets submitted to Faber take part in all special
                        draws that are offered uniformly by all lottery companies in the German Lotto and Toto block and
                        are therefore offered nationwide.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">4.2.6. An order is accepted by Faber if the account has a sufficient amount
                        to cover the stake and fees. The player waives the right to receive a declaration of acceptance.
                        Faber can also reject an order if there is an important reason. An important reason is, for
                        example, if the player's gaming behavior indicates that there is a risk of addiction.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">4.3 Certain tickets can be booked with the "permanent ticket" option. This
                        option is selected by the player when configuring the game and is displayed accordingly in the
                        shopping cart. The ticket initially takes part in one or more draws for the period selected on
                        the ticket (between 1 and 5 weeks). The amount to be paid for this period is shown to the player
                        in the shopping cart and - as with tickets without a permanent ticket option - is paid in
                        advance. The "permanent ticket" option means that the contractual relationship with Faber
                        regarding the submission of the ticket is extended indefinitely after the expiry of the term of
                        the first ticket. The subsequent continuous submission of permanent tickets is billed in certain
                        billing periods.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-6">
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">5. Conclusion of a game contract</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">5.1. Faber will forward an order placed to a lottery company. This
                        company is not obliged to accept game tickets and must therefore inform Faber of its decision on
                        acceptance. As part of its role as the player's representative, Faber is authorized to accept
                        declarations.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">5.2. After successfully concluding the game contract, the player receives a
                        confirmation of participation by email, which contains the information provided by the player,
                        the game tips, the stake and a clearly identifiable customer number. The player can also view
                        this information in his or her participation account. He or she will also be informed by email
                        which lottery company the contract was concluded with.
                        If the lottery company does not accept the game ticket sent by Faber, the player will be
                        informed and the stake and ticket fees will be refunded. No further claims arise.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-6">
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">6. Prizes</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">6.1. Faber does not charge any fees of its own for forwarding the
                        ticket. Faber informs the players about the stakes and ticket fees that are valid when the
                        ticket is submitted.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">6.2. The following costs apply to submitting a ticket for "Lotto
                        6aus49" (as of January 27, 2025):</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-2">

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">7. Payment transactions</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">7.1. The set up participation account must have sufficient funds
                        before the ticket is forwarded. If this is not the case, Faber can only issue tickets in
                        chronological order until the existing balance of the participation account is used up.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">7.2. Tickets can be paid for at Faber by direct debit or from the
                        participation account to which transfers and winnings are credited.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">7.2.1. Payments by direct debit are credited to the participation
                        account immediately. Faber is entitled to carry out a credit check of the player before
                        activating the direct debit procedure and as part of each payment process and to block the
                        option of paying by direct debit in the event of a negative credit rating or in the event of a
                        direct debit return. Faber can then offer an alternative payment method and, if necessary, block
                        the entire participation account. The data collected in this way is used exclusively for the
                        purpose of processing the direct debit procedure and is not passed on to any other third
                        parties.
                        If direct debits, chargebacks or other cost-causing problems in payment transactions arise due
                        to reasons for which the player is responsible (such as incorrect information, revocation or
                        insufficient funds in the specified account), the player must bear the resulting costs. Faber
                        also reserves the right to assign and/or sell the resulting outstanding claims, including the
                        bank and processing fees incurred, to a debt collection agency.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">7.2.2. By providing their bank details, the player authorizes the
                        corresponding amount to be debited from their specified account with each direct debit order.
                    </p>

                        order if the amount has already been credited to the participant account for six weeks.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">7.2.4. The bank details for payment by bank transfer are: Sparkasse

                        WELADED1BOC. The player's name or email address must be specified in the purpose of payment.
                        Bank transfers can only be credited to the play account after the amount has arrived in Faber's

                        stakes or paid out.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">8. Winnings</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">8.1. The player authorizes Faber to commission a trustee qualified to
                        independently practice a legal or tax advisory profession to collect the winnings accruing from
                        the selected lottery company (see the following conditions for the subject matter of the trust
                        agreement, in particular sections 8.4 and 8.5). The trustee is authorized by the player to
                        collect the winnings and is instructed to keep the game data sent to him (names of the players,
                        contact and winnings data). With regard to the trust agreement offer, Faber is the trustee's
                        authorized recipient and, by accepting the brokerage agreement, simultaneously accepts the trust
                        agreement in the name and on behalf of the trustee. This does not incur any costs for the
                        player.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">8.2. The player will be informed by Faber in the event of a win. Faber
                        is authorized by the player to provide the trustee with all the data necessary for collecting
                        the winnings (name of the player, contact and winnings data).</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">8.3. Only the trustee is authorized to claim the winnings.
                        Accordingly, the winnings are paid out exclusively to a trust account of the trustee.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">8.4. The trustee will transfer winnings of 256 euros or more to the
                        bank account specified by the player for the purpose of paying out the winnings immediately
                        after a payout by the lottery company. Faber is authorized to offset a negative balance on the
                        game account against a claim to a payout of the winnings before paying out winnings, provided
                        that the negative balance was caused by a direct debit return of direct debits from game
                        participation fees that had already been collected after participation in the game. Winnings of
                        less than 256 euros will be transferred by the trustee to the participating accounts managed by
                        Faber. The player can use this amount to continue playing with Faber or request a transfer to
                        the bank account designated for payment by informing Faber accordingly. Payments are only
                        possible after the player has been fully identified. The right to payment of winnings expires
                        with the trustee if it has not been asserted in writing to the trustee within three months. In
                        such a case, the trustee is obliged under Section 19 No. 3 of the State Treaty on Gambling in
                        Germany to transfer the winnings to the organizer after the deadline has expired.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">8.5. All transfers in accordance with Section 8.4 have a debt-discharging
                        effect for the trustee and Faber. If the player has not yet provided bank details for payment of
                        winnings, he will be asked to provide this information. There is no obligation to check the
                        account holder's authorization. For security reasons, amounts over 1,500 euros can only be
                        transferred after a copy of ID (front and back) has been sent and a legitimate bank account has
                        been provided. The name and date of birth must match the registered information.</p>

                    community)</h2>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">1. Declarations of intent by the player</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">1.1. If a player chooses to join a gaming community by selecting a
                        gaming community product and clicking on the button: "Submit for a fee", he or she is making an
                        offer to form a gaming community, which is to conclude a gaming contract in accordance with the
                        selected product. Faber informs the player of the amount of the fees that Faber will pay to the
                        respective state lottery company for concluding the gaming contract. It is then Faber's task to
                        conclude a partnership agreement with other players on behalf of the player to form a gaming
                        community. The gaming community should have a certain number of members (e.g. 40 or 100) and -
                        with Faber's mediation - submit lottery tips for state-approved lotteries to a lottery
                        organizer.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">1.2. The player authorizes Faber to carry out all legal transactions
                        to establish the gaming community and to accept declarations of intent from the gaming
                        community. He also authorizes Faber to negotiate gaming contracts between the gaming community
                        and the respective lottery organizer on behalf of the gaming community in accordance with the
                        product description (see section 3).</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">1.3. Faber is entitled to participate in gaming communities itself if
                        not all of the gaming community shares can be awarded by players by the closing date (see
                        section 4). In this case, the same rules apply to Faber as to the other players.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">1.4. By purchasing a share in the gaming community, the player also
                        instructs and authorizes Faber to inform him by email if the gaming community wins and to
                        instruct a trustee on behalf of the gaming community to claim any winnings from the respective
                        lottery organizer, to collect them and, after the gaming community is dissolved, to distribute
                        them equally to the members of the gaming community (see section B.8 for more details).</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">2.1. Faber accepts the offer to form a gaming community in accordance
                        with section C.1. by sending an email to the registered email address. In some cases, a
                        confirmation of receipt is sent before acceptance so that the player knows that his order has
                        been received. The offer is only accepted by the declaration of acceptance (which also includes
                        the game receipt for the gaming contract with the gaming community).</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">2.2. Even if the player is registered with Faber, he is not entitled to a
                        declaration of acceptance. Acceptance will not be declared if the player is blocked.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">3.1. Faber concludes a game contract with a lottery organizer on the
                        basis of the offer as a representative of the gaming community. Faber is entitled to determine
                        the individual betting lines of the gaming community at its own discretion. If you participate
                        in a gaming community repeatedly, you are not entitled to retain the game lines; the game lines
                        are usually different for each draw and are communicated to the player accordingly. When
                        concluding the game contract, Faber will also conclude the general terms and conditions of the
                        lottery organizer specifically selected in the individual case (see section A.1.). If you
                        participate in several lotteries at the same time, the relevant general terms and conditions of
                        the respective lottery organizers apply to the game contracts concluded in each case. The
                        special provisions of the respective lottery organizers apply to special draws (see also section
                        B.4.2.5).</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">3.2. Faber is the receiving agent of the gaming community with regard
                        to any declarations of acceptance or contract confirmations from the state lottery company.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">3.3. Faber sends the player and the other members of the gaming
                        community a game receipt by email after the conclusion of the gaming contract ("game receipt").
                        The game receipt contains the player's personal details, details of the specific game brokerage
                        order, the numbers selected or the lottery number, the name of the lotteries and the number of
                        the game ticket. It is possible that the game receipt is sent together with the declaration of
                        acceptance in accordance with C.2.1.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">3.4. If the lottery organizer does not accept the offer sent by Faber or
                        the gaming contract does not come into effect for other reasons, Faber will inform the player of
                        this immediately by email. In this case, the stake and fees will be refunded in full to the
                        players of the gaming community.</p>
